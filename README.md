# Tip_Calculator
This is a simple tip calculator application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input the total bill amount, choose a percentage for the tip, and specify the number of people sharing the bill. The app then calculates the total amount owed per person and displays it on the screen.
